  * Acclaimed for the scholarship of its prominent authors and the clarity of its narrative, AMERICAN GOVERNMENT: INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES sets the standard for public policy coverage while maintaining focus on three fundamental topics: the institutions of American government; the historical development of governmental procedures, actors, and policies; and who governs in the United States and to what ends. Reader involvement in the material is bolstered by features such as learning objectives, "Who Governs?" and "To What Ends?" questions framing each chapter, and "How Things Work" boxes that illustrate important concepts. Available separately, a state-of-the-art media package with new online tools makes the learning experience engaging and accessible.
